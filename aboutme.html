                    <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                      I am a dedicated professional who balances my career and family with commitment and passion. My years as a first responder, working in EMS, as a firefighter, and 911 dispatcher have shaped me into someone who thrives under pressure, thinks critically in high-stakes situations, and remains calm when it matters most. My experience in emergency services has instilled in me a deep sense of duty, resilience, and compassion, qualities that guide me in every aspect of my life.
Beyond my professional work in IT and public safety, I am a devoted husband and father, always striving to support and protect my family. One my families greatest traditions is our annual Christmas and Halloween displays, where we go all out with decorations to bring joy to our community. Each year, we use these events as an opportunity to give back by hosting charity drives for Sophie’s Circle in New Smyrna, Florida, helping provide food and care for pets in need.
I take pride in my strong work ethic, my dedication to growth, and my ability to problem-solve both in my career and at home. Whether I’m resolving complex technical challenges, helping others in moments of crisis, or creating meaningful moments with my loved ones, I lead with integrity, dedication, and heart.
